        <p>Hey, my name is Abdul Rehman and I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming. This is my first web project after a long time. I still remember my struggle with 'HTML for dummies' during 1998 to make a GeoCities web page. I was not serious about web development as a career back then.</p>

    <p>2022 is a different scenario for me. After losing a career job,  I switched gears and changed my line of work. From business management to information technology. I intend to form my own brand as <a target="_blank" href="https://bukharidigital.blogspot.com/">Bukhari Digital</a>. Currently, I am learning graphic design and web development side by side.</p>
    <p>I want to create easy-to-use web applications. AMS (accounts management system), HRIS (human resource information system), ATS (applicant tracking system), etc. are some of the examples. These web applications need a lot of learning such as JavaScript programming.</p>
    <p>My Github project is a commitment with myself to achieving all the goals that I am setting as of today (3rd March 2022). While walking down a new road, I intend to record the activities and sources I am learning from. I want to help other people struggling to learn a new skill. Especially information technology-based skills.</p>
    <p>You will feel that my work is maturing day by day, as I am learning and updating my web project almost weekly. I want to thank you for stopping by and taking some time off to read my words.</p>
